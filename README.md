# js-pandoc

is a fork of JS Markdown Extra
developed by tanakahisateru

which is based on JS Markdown Extra 1.01 
originally developed by [boumankan](http://bmky.net/product/js-markdown-extra/)

which implements the PHP Markdown Extra Syntax
by Michel Fortin, which you can test it here: [PHP Markdown Extra demo](http://www.michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/dingus/)

### What's this? ###

js-pandoc is *going to be* a JavaScript port of [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html); you can also [try it online](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/try).

I will try to create complete compatibility.

### Demo ###

You can try it yourself on the

[Demo page](/demo.html)

### How to use ###

Load this script in HTML and call ```Markdown``` function.

```javascript
	//example :
	var html = Markdown( text );
```
